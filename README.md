# Auction-for-fundraising-
Auction for fundraising Details - So, the project moto is to solve the problem in the In traditional online fundraising auction system, where the organizers collect items to be auctioned off for raising funds. But the main problem of this traditional system is that the bidder who won the highest bid is not able to track his/her money. There may be a chance that the fundraised will not actually deliver to a social cause but somewhere else or maybe the auction held was fraud. Solution to the problem is by using blockchain which is immutable and decentralized in nature along with the capability of tracking the data. The blockchain only allows authorized and authenticated users to take part that means fraudulent parties have no chance to cheat on this platform. Other than this users can track their money, data or any information in a minimum time. Wining bidding party can check or track that the fund raised by the auctioneer is going for social cause or not in a minimum time.
